        <h3>Things I learned from GQ</h3>
<p>How to throw a party</p>
<ul>
<li class="oss-item">As soon as your guests walk in the door, <b>make a round of drinks</b>. But, nothing too complicated -- you're hosting, not playing mixologist.

<li class="oss-item">Embrace your role as host. Make introductions, start conversations, get the night rolling. There's no shame in introducing X to Y by saying, "X meet Y: Both of you have a dog." A corny intro is like a corny pick up line -- as long as it works, everyone's happy.

<li class="oss-item">Manage your mood -- always be gracious. If you're pissed off because of how the soup is turning out, the dinner will never get its footing. Make jokes, enjoy yourself.

<li class="oss-item">And, it sounds obvious, but be present. Your guests are coming over to eat, not to wait for you to emerge from the kitchen. Design a meal that you can handle, not one that handles you.

<li class="oss-item">Refill, refill, refill. Never let a glass go empty.

<li class="oss-item">Put your party on ice. An ice bucket filled with bottles of white wine and champagne serves two purposes. First, it says, We're having a party, dammit. And second, it means you don't have to go to the fridge every time your guests need a refill. Just remember to fill the bucket with equal parts ice and water so the bottles are fully submerged and chilled to perfection.

<li class="oss-item">Make a house drink. Yes, you can set out a couple of bottles of bourbon and vodka, but serving a pitcher of drinks is both festive and easy. (e.g. Aperol-orange fizz: 1 bottle Aperol, 1 quart good orange juice, 1 orange sliced crosswise. Several bottles prosecco [.5 of each pitcher should be prosecco])

<li class="oss-item">A good vibe is as important as good food. Create a playlist that will keep your guests happy throughout the night -- and you from worrying about what CD to put on next

<li class="oss-item">Lots of candles. Cheap candles. Buy a mess of votives from Bed, Bath & Beyond.

<li class="oss-item">Dim the lights, not too dark (not romantic), but relaxing.

<li class="oss-item">Fill up glass carafes or vintage bottles with sparkling water and place them on the table.

<li class="oss-item">Not everything has to match. Use chipped vintage Wedgwood servingware from Grandma. It adds character and reminds your guests that they're in someone's home.

<li class="oss-item">Your apartment needs something alive in it. Pick up a dozen or so tulips and place them in a simple vase.

<li class="oss-item">Create a meal plan that's doable and coherent. Start with a single dish and build the rest of the meal around it. Stick with one theme (Italian, Asian, etc)

<li class="oss-item">Cook as much of the meal as you can ahead of time. You don't want to be stuck in the kitchen.

<li class="oss-item">Variety is key. You want a meat (or fish), a vegetable, a starch, a fruit, something spicy, something sweet. A meal should be balanced.

<li class="oss-item">Shop a day ahead of time, do prep work in the morning.

<li class="oss-item">Clean as you cook.

<li class="oss-item">Keep the hors d'oeuvres simple. Platter of store-bought olives, good cured meats, and quality cheeses. (one soft, one hard and sharp, one mild). Or (and?), fresh ricotta, drain, and puree in a good processor with a touch of whole milk. Place in a bowl and then top with extra-virgin olive oil, chopped fresh thyme or oregano, and a sprinkling of good sea salt (such as Maldon). Serve with crunchy bread or crackers. Or roasted nuts -- spread raw almonds on a baking sheet, slide it into a 300-degree oven, and roast till they're intoxicatingly fragrant. Serve immediately in a bowl with a round of stiff cocktails.

<li class="oss-item">Feed your guests, don't stuff them

<li class="oss-item">Everyone wants dessert. Even those who insist they only want a "tiny slice". Try serving the final course away from the dinner table. Service dessert in the living room.
