    I am a software developer at DRW Trading. I have a passion for discovering and maturing innovative solutions. My most 
    recent work has been in the Domain Specific Language space where I've delivered applications that empowered subject matter experts to 
    write the business rules of the applications.  I am also very interested in maturing software design through developer testing and 
    software testing in general.
