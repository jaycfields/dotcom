<h3>Refactoring: Ruby Edition Errata</h3>
<p>
Errors in the first printing:
<br><br>
<b>Page 9</b>, the amount_for method should have <code>this_amount</code> as the last line of the method. Without the additional <code>this_amount</code> the code can return nil when the inline if is false.
<br><br>
<b>Page 29</b>, the Customer class (UML) should contain <code>total_charge</code>, not <code>charge</code>
<br><br>
<b>Page 30</b>, in the html_statement method of the Customer class, <code>each.movie.title</code> should be <code>element.movie.title</code>
<br><br>
Despite our (Shane, Martin, Jay, and the copy editors) best care some errors always manage to get through. Please accept heartfelt apologies.

We would also like to thank those people who have contributed corrections: A. Lester Buck III.
